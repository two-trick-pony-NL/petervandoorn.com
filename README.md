## What is it: 
This is just simply my homepage that looks like a terminal, because I'm a bit of a geek. 
The page lives at https://petervandoorn.com and supports the following commands: 
- projects - to see my latest projects
- about - an about me section
- contact - for my contact details
- repo - to link you to this github page
- game - for fun
- clear - so you can clear up the terminal 

I also added some easter eggs for common commands like sudo, cat and rm rf. 

## how to run
- It's plain and simple HTML + Javascript so simply running the index.html in a browser should get you going 
- I plaid around a bit with CI/CD and the app is deployed by running a Github action that uploads the repo to Cpanel where I host the page.
